## JavaScript in the VS code editor 
    - Create a file and name "blabla.js"
    - To connect to the HTML page, need script at the bottom of the body just before the body close tag
## Conditional statements 
    - if ( some condition that is a boolean)\
    - Else if ( some condition that happens after failing the first if)
    - Else is the last part of conditions, if nothing else is true along the way, then run this. 
## Nesting 
 - We can nest conditionals inside other conditionals 
## Truthy and falsy values 
 - All js values have an inherent truthyness or fasyness abou them 
 - Falsy values: 
   - false 
   - 0 
   - "" (empty string)\
   - null 
   - undefiend
   - NaN
 - Everthing thhis else is truthy. 
## Logical operators 
- &&, both sides of the  and have to be true. if one is false then all are false 
- || or if one side is true then the whole thing is true. Only cares if one of the thing is true. 
- ! expression returns true if expression is false
