    <p>Function Scope
            Scope variable "visibilty" The location where a veriable is defied dictates where we hav3e acccess to thatt variable 
            Basically the information inside the fuction is has priority over the global information or information on the outside of the bubble. 
            Where ever the console.log is.. that is what will run. When there is one on the outsdie of brackets and inside of brackets the inside wins. 

            Block scope 
                Block refers to any time you have currly braces without a function 
                let and const, follow scoping rules aka only work within a block. 
                var is global, so it can get crazy when your trying to call apon stuff. 
                Does not have to be a function. if variables let and const are inside that block, then they only exist inside that world. 
        Lexical scope 
            nested or inner function has access to the same information as the parent or grandparent function 

        fuction expressions 
           You can store a function in a variable 
           we can pass funtions as an arguement 
           we can return functions like we return a number 
        Higher order funciton 
            functions that work or operate on other functions.
            funcations that accept other fucntions as arguments 
            functions that return funtctions 
        Methods 
            We can add funcitons as properties on objects 
            we call them Methods!
            Every method is a function but not every function is a method 
        Try/catch
            try {

            } catch {

            }
            Important to use to try errors before they fuck up your shit
