        Array callback methods!
            Subset of array methods that require us to pass in functions 

        forEach
            use to be very commonly used 
            allows us to run a fucntion once per element in an array 

        Map
            Call back array method 
            runs fucntions once per element in array and returns an array 

        filter 

        Arrow Function *crucial to write in these as a developer 
            new alternative to regular function expression 
            implicit return: 
                we can leave off the return keyword is certin situations 
                just repace the {curly brackets} with (parethsis)
                    or 
                You can have no curly or para and just put it all on one line 
                They only work when there is only one epression to evaluate and return.


        Some & Every; nameOf.every(); nameOf.some(); 
            boolean methods return true or false 
            Every, all of the elements have to pass 
            some, just some of the elemnts have to pass 

        The filter method 
            Used to filter out an array to make a subset or new array 
            Very usefull while trying to filter old or new items 
            funtion must be a bulloon to use, true or false 

        setTimeout and intervial 
            setTimeout wil control how long until somthing pops up
            setInteval does it but continuosly 
            clearInterval will stop setinteval, just set and const to it and give it a name to call

        Reduce 
                Execute a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single value. 
        Arrow function and 'this'
        You would not uses and arrow method to define an function
